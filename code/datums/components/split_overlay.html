This allows us to apply conditions, nick nacks, and animations to splitvis'd walls without massively bloating their DMIs (and thus leading to client performance issues)
Want to draw a cute animation on your wall but only if the SOUTH wall is exposed? this is how you do it (see also: hilbert doors)
Accepts an overlay to use, and a list of the directions to apply it in (see the icon_smoothing.dm defines for this list, which allow for angles to be specified seperately)
If the direction is blocked, the overlay won't draw. it'll also use as a dir the direction it's being drawn in
If the overlay has no plane/layer of its own, we'll give it ones that will at the least draw above wall splits, ensuring it actually renders</td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/aarrbba123/tgstation/tree/ab712f85327e1fccc0d94a73638abf61cc5bae86">ab712f8</a> (master) â€” <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.9.0</a></footer></body></html>
